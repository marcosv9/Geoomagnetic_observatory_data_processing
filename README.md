# Download_ftp

The function was created to automatize a daily task.

Daily, the brazilian technicians need to download many files from the GFZ ftp server and store them in specific directories.

The data are from our geomagnetic observatories and stations, that continually measures the geomagnetic field.

So, the function automatically download and store the files in the correct directory, for each observatory and station.

The user can specify the date range of files to be downloaded and also the observatories and stations.
